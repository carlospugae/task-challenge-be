# Task Challenge

This is a small BE I made based on the [following specs](docs/specs.pdf).

## What's included

- Typescript
- Error handling
- Validations
- An actual db (Mongo)
- Fully dockerized

## What's left

- Unit testing (not enough time ðŸ˜ž)
- Production Deployment
- CI/CD

## Setup

1. Generate .env file by running the following command `cp .env.sample .env `
2. Run `npm -i` in order to install all dependencies.
3. Run `docker-compose build` in order to build docker images.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to get the app up & running.
5. Enjoy
